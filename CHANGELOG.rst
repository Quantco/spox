Change log
==========

0.9.3 (2023-10-23)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Address missing Value Infos when building singleton model for shape inference.
- Fix issue where Value Propagation failure prevents model creation/inlining.


0.9.2 (2023-10-20)
------------------

**Other changes**

- Fix a deprecation warning from one of Spox's dependencies.

0.9.1 (2023-10-05)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- The node-adaption no longer fails if faced with a node that has repeating inputs.
- Forego version adaption of inlined models if no nodes are from the default domain.


0.9.0 (2023-06-12)
------------------

**New feature**

- The opset ``ai.onnx@19`` (ONNX 1.14) is now shipped with Spox.

**Bug fixes**

- The constructor for ``ai.onnx@18::Split`` is no longer generated incorrectly. No extraneous attribute is generated anymore, and the ``num_outputs`` attribute is marked as required (so that Spox can infer the number of outputs).
- Fix an issue where op.const handled numbers in the range(INT64MAX, UINT64MAX) incorrectly

**Other changes**

- Inlining now no longer adds redundant ``Identity`` nodes and supports subgraphs, thanks to reimplementing the ONNX renaming routine.


0.8.1 (2023-05-xx)
------------------

**Bug fixe**

- An explicit error is now raised when local subgraph arguments are leaked to an outer scope. This may happen when the subgraph callback uses side effects saving local variables, which would produce later a confusing error message.

0.8.0 (2023-05-11)
------------------

This version is intended as a release candidate for ``1.0.0``.

**New feature**

- Spox now explicitly sets a model's IR version (currently to version 8) rather than defaulting to the latest IR version supported by the installed onnx package. Increasing the IR version is not considered a breaking change going forward. The IR version will be increase once the ecosystem has adopted it more broadly.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix an issue with resolving scopes during the build process. They manifested with a ``KeyError`` in accessing variables in scope on graphs in complex dependencies between subgraphs.
- ``inline`` now removes all symbolic dimensions from input/output shapes (i.e. ``N x 2`` becomes ``? x 2``) before inferring types to avoid inconsistent interactions. This is only a visual change of the output in some cases, as they are not compared strictly in ONNX.
- ``inline`` now explicitly does not accept model with subgraphs and local functions. Attempting to use these would usually result in invalid models. Support for them will be added in the future.

0.7.0 (2023-04-04)
------------------

This version is intended as a release candidate for ``1.0.0``.

**New features**

- The opset ``ai.onnx@18`` is now shipped with Spox (version 18 of the default domain, as introduced in ONNX 1.13). To avoid code duplication, unchanged implementations are 'inherited' from the previous version.

**Breaking changes**

- The typing rules of the (previously partially documented) extra constructor ``const`` have changed. Its signature is now ``const(npt.ArrayLike, npt.DTypeLike = None) -> Var``. In particular, ``const`` of a Python ``float`` no longer becomes ``float32``, but ``float64`` like numpy - this is a **breaking change**. The operator is redefined to be equivalent to ``constant(numpy.array(value), dtype)``, instead of a complex set of cases like before.
- The ``Type <= Type`` (``Type.__le__``) overload is now removed.
- Deprecated operator constructors are now no longer generated after the version their schema was deprecated. Effectively, this means ``ai.onnx@17::Scatter`` and ``ai.onnx@17::Upsample`` (available as ``op.scatter`` and ``op.upsample``) are no longer available in ``spox.opset.ai.onnx.v17``. They likely were not used in practice as attempting to build deprecated operators has always failed.

**Bug fixes**

- The operator constructor ``cum_sum`` now also has an alias ``cumsum``, to mirror ``numpy``. This alias should be preferred.

**New unstable features**

- ``spox._future.initializer(ArrayLike, DTypeLike = None) -> Var`` is a new function for creating variables from a constant value. The created value is constructed with ``numpy.array`` and follows the same rules. This function is opset-independent and is implemented using initializers.

0.6.2 (2023-03-29)
------------------

**Pending breaking changes**

- The previously available ``Type <= Type`` (``Type.__le__``) overload is deprecated and will be removed in Spox ``0.7.0``, as it was unintentionally public.
- Constructors for deprecated ONNX operators (currently ``Scatter`` and ``Upsample``) now raise a warning when they are called. They will be removed entirely in ``0.7.0``.

**Bug fixes**

- ``spox.inline`` now correctly renames unused model inputs when building. This could previously cause invalid models to be built.
- Array attributes are now copied when they are passed to an operator. This avoids accidentally mutating them after the operator is constructed.
- The ``Loop`` operator now has patched type inference, so that the loop-carries in its results preserve shapes if the subgraph had them inferred.

0.6.1 (2023-03-07)
------------------

**Pending breaking changes**

- An undocumented extra operator constructor (``const``) now raises a ``DeprecationWarning`` on ``float``, as its behaviour will change in Spox ``0.7.0`` to follow that of ``numpy``.


0.6.0 (2023-02-27)
------------------

**New features**

- ``spox.inline`` was added to the public interface, allowing embedding existing ONNX models in Spox.

**Other changes**

- Models now have a minimum opset version of ``14`` for the ``ai.onnx`` domain to avoid issues with low-versioned models in ORT and other tooling.

**Breaking changes**

- The operator constructor for ``MatMul`` - ``mat_mul`` - has been renamed to ``matmul`` to follow numpy naming.

0.5.0 (2023-01-20)
------------------

**New features**

- The ``spox.build`` and ``spox.argument`` functions were added enabling the building of graphs through a stable interface.

**Notable changes**

- The documentation formatting inside the (auto-generated) ``spox.opset`` module was greatly improved.


0.4.0 (2023-01-16)
------------------

**Breaking changes**

- Removed the ``Var.dtype`` and ``Var.shape`` properties in favor of the more explicit ``Var.unwrap_tensor().dtype`` and ``Var.unwrap_tensor().shape`` ones.

**Bug fixes**

- Non-ASCII characters in constant tensors are now handled correctly.
- The ``Compress`` operator has gained an explicit type and shape inference implementation


0.3.0 (2022-12-20)
------------------

**Notable changes**

- Renamed the library to Spox
- Reduced the public API surface to a bare minimum such that downstream packages may offer a usable and stable user experience with spox-based converters. This release is intended as a release candidate. Breaking changes may still occur if necessary.
